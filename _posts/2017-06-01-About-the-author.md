Hello. I'm Mark, an engineering major turned programmer. I first learned to program when I was quite young from my parents. Everyone in my family are in the programming field--even my grandfather, who started Delcambre Software, Inc. Going through my teenage years I swore off CS and went off to become a civil engineer... That lasted longer than most thought, about 7 years (counting college), but now I am back. This blog provides a place to document some of the projects I am working on. My open source projects can be found on my <a href="http://github.com/mdelcambre" target="_blank">Github</a>
